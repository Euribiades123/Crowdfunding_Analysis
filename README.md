# Crowdfunding_Analysis

Create a report in Microsoft Word, and answer the following questions:
	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
	That crowdfunding has about a 56.5% success rate
	Staring a crowdfunding campaign doesn’t exactly guarantee success being that there’s about a 50% chance of success so it is very risky
	Film, video, music, and theater seem to make up the bulk of crowdfunding campaigns. Journalism the lowest. Although journalism has a 100% success rate. 
•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
	Is hard to tell which categories are more successful and which aren’t. 
•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
	Percentage or campaigns that where successful, failed or cancelled by category or subcategory 
	Add a table by country to see what category did best and where
•	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
	I believe that the Median would better summarize the data. It seems that the higher the number of backers the more likely it was for a campaign to be successful. So, it is likely that a number higher that the median would give promising results
•	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
o	There is more variability with more successful campaigns. It seems that the higher the number of backers, the more likely it is for a campaign to be successful, and this will cause variability to be higher.
